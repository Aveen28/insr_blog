# Aveen Vas

I'm a Master's student in **Computer Science (Autonomous Systems)** at **UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart**, with a focus on **scientific machine learning**, **neural representations for PDEs**, and **physics-informed AI**. My work combines deep learning with numerical methods to solve complex, real-world physical problems more efficiently.
